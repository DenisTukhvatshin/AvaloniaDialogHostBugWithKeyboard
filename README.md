# AvaloniaDialogHostBugWithKeyboard
 I found an error when opening a dialog box in Android, when filling in text fields (for example, I have them named login and password). And further clicking on any button will cause an error.  Actions:  1. Add in View TextBox and Button with CloseDialogCommand 2. Run application in Android 3. Show View 4. Click in the text box, the android keyboard appears on the screen 5. Click to close Button 6. We see that the application has terminated with an error
